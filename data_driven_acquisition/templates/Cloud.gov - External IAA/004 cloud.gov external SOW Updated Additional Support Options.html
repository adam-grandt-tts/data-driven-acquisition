<p><strong><u>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR TTS SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO </strong></u><strong><u>AGENCY, OFFICE</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>1.0.	BACKGROUND</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (the Servicing Agency), through the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) within the Federal Acquisitions Service (FAS), builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between Government and the people and businesses it serves. TTS helps agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services.</p>

<p>Cloud.gov is a platform-as-a-service developed by TTS to help federal agencies deliver digital services and operate efficiently at-scale in a cloud-hosted environment.  Cloud.gov automates the security settings for any web service and configures the service to meet federal security requirements. Cloud.gov also provides agencies with a user interface that displays data such as usage metrics and how many servers are running to allow agencies to easily monitor and manage their usage of cloud services, which would otherwise require multiple layers of staffing. Cloud.gov provides agencies with templates for cloud security documentation to make the Authority to Operate (ATO) process more efficient for agencies. </p>

<p>TTS will provide access to the cloud.gov platform and its capabilities and maintains the cloud.gov platform and infrastructure security compliance up to the application level and agencies access the platform on a self-service level to host their systems. </p>

<p>The Requesting Agency, for purposes of this Statement of Work (SOW), is the AGENCY (AGENCY Acronym), (office). Agency, Office seeks access to cloud.gov in order to provide efficient hosting and achieve cost savings in deployment of software using cloud services.</p>

<p>4.  Provide the Requesting Agency usage logs for cloud.gov and supporting cloud services</p>
<p>5. Provide the Requesting Agency with a basic level of support that includes on-site training, portfolio analysis, replatforming assistance, priority support, and co-development of custom services (Note: additional support is available on a reimbursable basis)</p>

Cloud.gov will notify the Requesting Agency of changes to the price at least 30 days before the agreement is up for renewal.</p>

<p>The following cost breakdown is an estimate based on the access package you select and expected memory usage. TTS will be reimbursed for the actual usage costs based on the amount of memory (RAM) that you reserve for your system. The Requesting Agency can change the service (such as number or type of access packages and amount of usage) during the agreement by requesting the change via email to Cloud.gov (<u>https://cloud.gov/docs/help/</u>). A change in the service will likely impact the agreement amount and require an amendment to this agreement. </p>
