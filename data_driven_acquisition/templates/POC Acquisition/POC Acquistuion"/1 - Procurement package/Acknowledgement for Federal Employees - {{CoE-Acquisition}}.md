# ACKNOWLEDGMENT REGARDING
# NONDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
# AND STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT

With respect to my duties as an employee of the General Services Administration, I understand that matters assigned to me may include my access to official and/or nonpublic information. This material may relate to many areas of GSA's responsibilities, including, but not limited to, procurements (e.g., acquisition planning, evaluation, negotiations, and source selection), regulation and rulemaking, internal policy decisions, contract claims and litigation, and Congressional matters. I hereby acknowledge the following:

1.  I am familiar with, and understand that I am bound by, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. Part 2635. Specifically, I understand that I cannot use my public office for private gain and cannot engage in financial transactions using nonpublic information. I also cannot allow the improper use of nonpublic information to further my own private interests or that of another, whether through advice or recommendation, or by knowing unauthorized disclosure.

2.  I understand that I am bound by 18 U.S.C. ยง 208. This conflict of interest statute prohibits me from participating personally and substantially as a Government employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which I have a financial interest. I also understand that the financial interest of my spouse, minor children, general partner, organization in which I serve as an officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee, and any person or organization with whom I am negotiating or have any arrangements regarding future employment, are imputed to me for the purposes of this statute. Finally, I understand that I have a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstances which may create a real or apparent conflict of interest. In the event that a real or apparent conflict of interest arises, I will immediately report the conflict to my supervisor, and will not work on the matter until I receive instructions from my supervisor.    

3. I am familiar with, and understand that I am bound by, the requirements of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1905, which provides:

Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, any person acting on behalf of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or agent of the Department of Justice as defined in the Antitrust Civil Process Act (15 U.S.C. 1311, 1312, 1313, and 1314), or being an employee of a private sector organization who is or was assigned to an agency under Chapter 37 of title 5, publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association; or permits any income return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person except as provided by law; shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and shall be removed from office or employment.

4. I understand that, unless authorized by law, the public release by me of nonpublic information is prohibited. 

5. Unless authorized by law, I understand that I shall not disclose or reveal any information to anyone who is not also an authorized participant in the matter (and then only to those who need to know) which:

would provide undue, discriminatory, or competitive advantage to an offeror or other private interest (including information contained in vendor proposals and the identity or number of offerors);
is or reflects confidential commercial information submitted by an offeror or which could reasonably be expected to cause competitive harm to an offeror;
is otherwise protected from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, or  other authority;
pertains to internal agency communications regarding an agency matter; or
has been designated "Source Selection Information."  

6.  If furnished with a proposal, or a proposed interim or final rule, or a policy matter, I shall:

use the information contained therein only in performing the job duties of my position;
comply with any restrictive notice which may have been placed on materials related to the matter; and
upon completion of my assignment, safeguard and/or dispose of all copies of the material related to the matter in accordance with applicable law.

7. I am aware that an unauthorized disclosure of procurement, rulemaking, policy or other information may subject me to criminal, civil, and/or administrative penalties.
